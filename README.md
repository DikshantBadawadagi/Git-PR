# Autonomous Code Review Agent System

An AI-powered system designed to autonomously analyze GitHub pull requests. The agent reviews code, identifies potential issues, and provides structured feedback through a robust API. The project leverages asynchronous task processing and a goal-oriented AI agent to streamline code reviews.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: Code reviews handled asynchronously using Celery.
- **AI Code Review Agent**: Analyzes code for:
  - Code style and formatting issues.
  - Potential bugs or errors.
  - Performance improvements.
  - Adherence to best practices.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - **POST** `/analyze-pr`: Submit a pull request for analysis.
  - **GET** `/status/<task_id>`: Check the status of an analysis task.
  - **GET** `/results/<task_id>`: Retrieve the results of an analysis.
- **Storage Options**: Results stored in Redis or PostgreSQL for persistence.
- **Extensible Framework**: Supports AI frameworks like LangChain, Crewai, LiteLLM, or Autogen.

## üìã Core Requirements

### 1. **API Endpoints (FastAPI)**

#### POST `/analyze-pr`

Accepts GitHub PR details for analysis:
```json
{
  "repo_url": "https://github.com/user/repo",
  "pr_number": 123,
  "github_token": "optional_token"
}
GET /status/<task_id>
Retrieve the current status of a submitted task.

GET /results/<task_id>
Fetch detailed analysis results.

2. Asynchronous Task Processing
Celery for asynchronous task execution.
Task statuses: pending, processing, completed, failed.
Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms.
3. AI Agent Implementation
The agent analyzes:

Code style and formatting.
Bugs and potential errors.
Performance improvements.
Adherence to best practices.
Example Output:

json
Copy code
{
  "task_id": "abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "results": {
    "files": [
      {
        "name": "main.py",
        "issues": [
          {
            "type": "style",
            "line": 15,
            "description": "Line too long",
            "suggestion": "Break line into multiple lines"
          },
          {
            "type": "bug",
            "line": 23,
            "description": "Potential null pointer",
            "suggestion": "Add null check"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_files": 1,
      "total_issues": 2,
      "critical_issues": 1
    }
  }
}
